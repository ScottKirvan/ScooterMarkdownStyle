I'm finding some elements that don't deploy/publish properly.  I'll have to find out where to
report these.

## Alternate Headers
Underlined H2 Headers don't format properly 

Raw:
```

## Github style Note/Warning callouts

```
> **Note** 
> GitHub Note callout
```

> **Note** 
> GitHub Note callout

```
> **Warning** 
> GitHub Warning callout
```

> **Warning** 
> GitHub Warning callout

These are parsed as plain paragraph text.
They need a &lt;span&gt; or something so the css can style it.

# Tables
Table formatting breaks when preceded by a paragraph without a break.
